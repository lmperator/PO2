This project is made for PO at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology by Artur Laskowski using Java.

This should be a game.
It will be the game where in which you have to typing from keyboard as fast as you can.
There will be the list of the best results.

Design of application:
The start window with tree buttons.
Start, about, quit.
etc.

Start:
The main part, where I suppose to place the game.
There will appear the text.
In the other box you have to put you version of it.
After each the result will be showed, and if you have enough points ( good characters ) then you will be submitted in the ranking.

About:
Just few info about author, thats me.

Exit:
I think that i should explain nothing.

The game, how to implement it:
I will write it from the view of user.
The window will show off.
There you have three buttons, as I wrote in upper part of this document.
First from top is Start, where game will be launched.
This window has to disappear, and second will reveal.
In the second one there will be two boxes.
First with text from database.
Second with empty place, where you have to put exactly the same text.
The points will be given for correct letter in right place.
The time will be measured simultaneously.
After the last character the time will be stopped and the score will be given.
The formula is [ correct character ] over [ time in seconds ].
If your result is good enough then it will be submitted.
Another window has to appear, where we could find the box in which you have to put your nick.
After that you will see the ranking in another window, after clicking OK, you will be redirected to first window.

In second bottom of first window you could go to ABOUT, where you could see some info or click OK, and return.
After click EXIT you will terminate the application with some statement. 
In any moment you could terminate the game, and it will be closed without any statement.

Implementation issues:
During the game there will be two threads.
One will measuring the time, second will keep the game, with window etc.
There will be another threat, which will be the supervisor, and if in anytime somebody click X, then the game will be the past.
There will be one adding file with ranking ( name, result ).

I think thats everything, but maybe I will add something later.
